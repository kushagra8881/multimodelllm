# Multimodal Language Model with Q-Learning Optimization

## Introduction
This repository contains code for building a multimodal language model capable of processing images and generating text outputs. The model leverages Q-Learning for optimization and Softmax for decision-making, providing a comprehensive approach to multimodal understanding and generation.

## Features
- **Multimodal Input**: Accepts both textual and image inputs for processing.
- **Text Generation**: Generates text outputs based on the input context and image features.
- **Q-Learning Optimization**: Utilizes Q-Learning to optimize model performance and decision-making.
- **Softmax Decision-Making**: Implements Softmax function for probabilistic decision-making in the model.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed with a modular architecture for flexibility and easy extension.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kushagra8881/multimodal_language_model.git
